    "Immersed in the vibrant world of art, I find boundless joy in both creating captivating murals and nurturing young minds through the medium of teaching. Every stroke of the brush carries a story waiting to unfold, as I pour my passion onto the canvas, transforming blank spaces into breathtaking visual narratives. The vivid colors and intricate details interweave to evoke emotions and ignite imaginations, leaving a lasting impression on all who witness the artwork's transformative power.",
  aboutme_para2:
    "My passion for art started when I was a toddler and my mom was teaching me English and Burmese. She would write the words and draw the pictures and when I had to trace over them I realized I like the visual aspect of learning the best and it became my favorite form of learning and now my hobby and form of making money.",
